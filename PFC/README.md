# Instructions

The Script as well as the .tar .ipk files should be loaded on the PFC via an SD card. Once you've got the files into the SD card and insert the card into the PFC, you must go into the sd card directory. Access the command line via SSH (xPutty or whatever software you prefer) and type the follow instructions.

```
cd /media/<sd_card_name>/
```

Then run the script in the sd card directory via 

```
sh setup.sh
```

Once completed, go to your web browser and connect to <IP_address_of_PFC>:1880
